## Tasks
In this project, we implemented:
- Persistent storage, using SQL lite to save user data and purchases during the first 2 sprints. In the 3rd sprint, we switched to Firebase.
- API consumption using the Volley and Gson libraries, both created by Google.
- User session management using FirebaseAuth.
- Manipulation of UI elements defined in XML files.
- Use and creation of Fragments.
- E-mail sending.
- Image retrieval using the device's gallery and internal storage.
- Use of device's camera.
- Image loading using the Picasso library.
- Device's permissions management, such as permission to use device's internet connection, user's exact location, among others.
- Sharing purchases by social media.

## Features
- Users can register and login into their account.
- Forgot password functionality.
- User's tab, which allows users to modify their account information, like name, location, or age. They can also set their profile picture by choosing from the gallery or taking a new picture from the camera.
- Store's tab, where users can add products to their shopping cart.
- Shopping cart's tab, where users can see which products are in their respective shopping carts, as well as modifying quantities of products or removing products altogether. Shopping cart's tab is where users can confirm their purchase, too.   
- Purchase history screen, where users can check their past purchases in detail. They can also share any of their purchases in a social media network of their choice.
